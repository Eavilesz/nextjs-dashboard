# Invoice Management Dashboard

This is a responsive **Next.js** application designed as part of the official [Next.js course](https://nextjs.org/learn). The project serves as a **Dashboard** to manage invoices, providing full CRUD functionalityâ€”users can create, delete, view, and update invoices. The app uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage. Originally, the project was built using the `@vercel/postgres` library, but as a challenge post-course completion, I successfully migrated it to **Prisma** (`@prisma/client`), enhancing the database management experience.

## Features

- **Invoice CRUD**: Users can create, view, update, and delete invoices.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Secure and efficient storage of invoice data.
- **Prisma ORM**: Replaced `@vercel/postgres` with Prisma for advanced database querying.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes to enhance usability.
- **Next.js Framework**: Utilizes the powerful features of Next.js for both server-side and client-side rendering.

## Tech Stack:

- Next.js: Server-side rendering and static generation.
- PostgreSQL: For managing invoice data.
- Prisma: Replaced @vercel/postgres for robust database queries.
- Tailwind CSS: For responsive and clean styling.
